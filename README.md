# Transfer-learning-using-VGG-16-for-accident-detection-using-images
Real-world traffic surveillance recordings need constant monitoring in order to detect and respond to deadly incidents. Being constantly monitoring vehicles while they're in motion can be very time-consuming and prone to error. Therefore, to detect accidents using images, one of the pre-trained models â€“ VGG - 16 with Convolutional Neural Network has been proposed![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/78974822/203916428-17784fe8-9c58-49d1-bbc7-c0e3b9ba10c1.png)
